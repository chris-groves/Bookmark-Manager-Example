## User Stories

```
As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly go to web sites I regularly visit
I would like to see a list of bookmarks
```

##Database Setup

Connect to psql in the terminal
Create a new database using the command => CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
Connect to the database using the command => \c bookmark_manager;
Run the query saved in the 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql file to create the required database tables
